This was not what happened.<br><br>The ascendancy of Lincoln Chafee to the Democratic nomination was not foreseen by even the most prophetic of political prophets. The ugly duckling of the 2016 election cycle has gone from polling near political absolute zero to being a rising phoenix nominee in a matter of months. After an endorsement from a spiteful Biden out for revenge against his primary rival Hillary, Chafee would soak up enough of the moderate and dovish vote to narrowly eek out a win at the convention, filled with super delegates turned off by Clinton’s backroom tactics but uncomfortable with the left wing populism of Bernie Sanders.<br><br>This election season is also mired by a man somehow even more terrifying to establishment politics, the bloviating billionaire who's rallied the backwoods Republican vote, Donald Trump. Chafee, widely viewed as dry and doddering, is seen by the Democrats as the last bastion of hope against the oncoming wave of right-wing populism, and to say Americans dread going to the polls this year would be a grave, grave understatement.</p></div>",

He’s made clear he would be willing to switch his party affiliation all the way should you win as well. With Trump alienating much of the moderate Republican vote, Baker could be a way to pull parts of Romney and McCain’s erstwhile coalitions out from under the Donald, as well as driving up enthusiasm from the sheer irregularity of a cross-party ticket. You think you could frame it as a bipartisan stand against Trump’s hate.<br><br>Then again, the risks are clear and innumerable. You would be all but completely cutting ties with the progressive left, burning many bridges among establishment democrats, and it’s unclear if there even is that much of a moderate Republican vote left anyway. He’s also another white governor from your neck of the woods, and in that way you may not even need him on the ticket to get that sweet sweet centrist vote.
