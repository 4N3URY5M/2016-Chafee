			<h3>Deplorable</h3>
			<p>Hillary looked on in awe that night as the map flooded blood red. Chafee had lost, sure, but he had lost by a margin nobody had expected. Nobody but her.</p>
			<p>A wicked grin spread across her wrinkled face as she watched as Chafee’s dreams were crushed forever. His career was over, he had been taken care of. He was a useful idiot; he taught her what Trump is made of, what makes him tick, what his weaknesses are. Now, Chafee could be safely disposed of. He should be grateful that he could be her sacrificial lamb.</p>
			<p>Years will pass. 2018 will be hellfire for the Republicans. 2020 will be worse. The Democrats, lost and seeking leadership, will turn to what they know best: Hillary. She will guide them, she will prevail, no matter what. And she will crush Trump like an insect. “Madam President…” the news anchors will read out dryly. The power to shape history will be in her hands. The new world order is yet to be constructed.</p>
			<p>Hillary was getting ahead of herself.</p>
			<p>There was much to do, after all. She had to ensure that the others–the Bernies and Bidens of the party–were powerless to stop her. Chafee was just a practice round.</p>
			<p>The dominance of neoliberalism was at hand. The end of history had just begun.</p>

				<h1 style="margin-left: 10px; text-align: left;">How Twitter is helping Chafee achieve his authoritarian dreams</h1>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Twitter’s “#RepealThe22nd” movement may actually lead to a major constitutional crisis if Chafee has his way.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Sep 17, 2023, 7:30am EST</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Last week, users on Twitter began making posts with the hashtag “RepealThe22nd”, and have gone viral ever since. Constitutional scholars and GOP legislators alike warn that this may be signalling the US’s descent into dictatorship.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Many of these posts are in support of President Chafee and urge him to run for a third term amidst a plethora of concerns over Chafee’s alleged connections to Russian oligarchs and refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine. Last Thursday, Congresswoman Rebekah Jones introduced a joint resolution to repeal the 22nd Amendment and permit Chafee to run for re-election.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Democrats from both chambers of Congress have come out in support of the resolution, and Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin is strongly in support.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">“Too long has effective government been sidelined in the name of waging political battles,” said Durbin on MSNBC. “If President Chafee wishes to seek a third term, then I think we should let him do that. Ultimately, the decision to grant him that third term lies with the American people.”</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Republican legislators, however, are less keen on the whole idea. Senator Ben Sasse, for one, is staunchly opposed, stating that repealing the 22nd Amendment would be doing “a great disservice to what Washington intended for this country. We need to think in the long term, not in the short term.”</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Lawyers and academics seem to agree. 48 constitutional scholars and law experts wrote an open letter directing Congress to block any attempt to repeal the 22nd Amendment. The letter warns that a hypothetical repeal could “upset the delicate constitutional balance that has been upheld for two centuries” and “tear apart the fabric of our democracy”.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">President Chafee, for his part, remains silent on the matter.</p>

				<h1 style="margin-left: 10px; font-family: 'Georgia'; font-size: 40px; text-align: left;"><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em></h1>
				<h2 style="margin-left: 10px; color: #444;">It’s a terrifyingly relevant dystopian drama about a far-gone United States. It’s also an enrapturing watch.</h2>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px; color: #777;">April 17, 2017 • 9:02 PM</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Since its publication in 1985, Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;"><em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em></span> has never gone out of relevance. At times, it was seen as prescient; at others, it was viewed as cautionary. When Lincoln Chafee&rsquo;s victory seemed almost inevitable in 2016, the book seemed to be at a safe distance away from our reality. But three months into the Cotton presidency, it seems that the fictional Republic of Gilead is closer than ever.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The setting of <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> is a near-future totalitarian theocracy, the aforementioned Republic of Gilead, which used to be the United States until the American government faced a total upheaval by a group of Christian fundamentalists. Sound familiar? The Gileadian government came to power due to a sharp decline in birth rates as a result of harsh environmental pollution. This led to the creation of an underclass of women used as &ldquo;handmaids&rdquo;, forced to bear children for their masters. Gileadian society sees women as nothing more than tools for reproduction.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">Tom Cotton&rsquo;s government, as <span style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: red;">many have noted</span>, bears a striking resemblance to that of Gilead in many aspects. Cotton, for one, has already made promises to overturn Roe v. Wade during his presidency, which would set women&rsquo;s rights back by decades. He filled his cabinet with far-right Christian fundamentalists like Jeff Sessions, who would gladly establish a theocracy given the chance. And the ways that <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> are not a terrifying one-to-one parallel to our current situation are a part of its anxiety-inducing power. Like an unseen horror, lurking in the shadows, creating terror in the act of being unseen, the vagueness of <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em> leaves much to the imagination. How will the seemingly limitless contempt for women present in our current political climate play out? What would the Cotton administration do in the case of a serious national emergency? Or rather, what <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> they do?</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">The series, narrated by handmaid Offred (Elisabeth Moss), is rife with Atwood’s acerbic prose, exemplifying the hopelessness of the nightmare Offred finds herself living through. She details what her life was like in the past in flashbacks to “before”, to her husband and daughter, to the day her and all of her female coworkers had their bank accounts transferred to their husbands or next of male kin. She tells us about when extremists seized control of the government, when they suspended the Constitution, when Americans didn’t “wake up”. When people took to the streets, it was already too late.</p>
				<p style="margin-left: 10px;">And now, three months into Tom Cotton’s presidency, we have to ask ourselves: is it already too late?</p>
